                Proudly local and Proudly Maori

    Haukai Restaurant specializes in Māori kai and is based in the Bay of Islands. What started as a small passion project, has grown into a 
    desire to not only feed the locals a great Maori influenced meal, but also to educate all guests the importance of Maori culture in food.
    The owners have a long term goal to incoperate more Maori inspired cooking techniques in conjunction with modern styles. The ever changing menu looks
    to reflect this. Sourcing only local produce is hugely important to Haukai as well as providing living wages to our employees. Everything we 
    do we do with the enviroment in mind, therefore all products we serve and will serve will only ever be sustainably products and we will endeavour to always locally.
    To read more about Maori culture and cooking we have provided a link below to a local website that explains the process with visuals to understand how things 
    used to done.
